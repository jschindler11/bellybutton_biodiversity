# bellybutton_biodiversity

We visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If a species is identified as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, we will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Specifically, we created visualizations for the top 10 bacteria cultures found, the frequency of belly button washing (in scrubs per week), and the amount of bacteria cultures per sample.
